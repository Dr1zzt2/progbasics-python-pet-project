001. a simple room with mossy walls and some rats in it.
002. a small room with carrions and dried blood all around the place.
003. a dark room with chains.
004. a cozy room with torches providing warm. There is an old table in the middle with some leftovers.
005. a large room with a dark pit in the middle. Will you jump in the Abyss?
006. a gloomy cave, full of mushrooms and small insects.
007. a huge cave with fireflies providing light. There is a waterfall on the side. Maybe there are treasures behind it?
008. a dark cave, echoing with screams. They are never end.
009. a cave system full of giant tropical plants. Those yellow fruits... are they edible?
010. a tall cave, with an altar. Sunlight shines upon it from above.
011. a bar with a crafty innkeeper. Would you rather remember, or forget?
012. an icy, frozen cave. You might freeze here.
013. a room. A simple. empty room. Wait... are those spiders?
014. a room with beds and torches. Writings are on the wall. With blood and coal.
015. a cave with a river running across. You see a bridge glowing with green light.
016. a room full of withering books. All written in a languange unknown, long forgotten.
017. a room full of rats.
018. a cave so dark you can't see anything. Does being blind feel like this?
019. a hall full of empty chests.
020. a hall with broken tiles. Dirt, grass everywhere and light shines through a breach in the wall. It's your way out of here.
